# Matrix Teams & Manager Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Implementing hierarchical work diary management with matrix team assignments, manager dashboards, and immutable approval workflows.

## Key Features
1. **Matrix Team Assignments**: Employees can belong to multiple teams/projects
2. **Manager Dashboards**: Managers see only their assigned teams/projects
3. **Approval Workflow**: First approval locks entry (immutable)
4. **Company Oversight**: Company can approve any pending entry as fallback
5. **Audit Trail**: Track who approved what and when

## Database Schema Updates

### Teams/Projects Table
- id, name, description, company_id
- manager_id (assigned manager)
- created_at, updated_at

### Employee-Team Assignments
- employee_id, team_id, company_id
- assigned_at, assigned_by

### Enhanced Work Entries
- team_id/project_id reference
- approval_status: pending/approved/rejected
- approved_by_id, approved_by_type (manager/company)
- approval_time, approval_comments

### Manager Accounts
- Separate manager authentication
- Linked to company through invitations
- Role-based permissions

## Workflow Logic
1. Employee submits work entry with team_id
2. Entry appears in assigned manager's dashboard + company dashboard
3. First approver (manager or company) locks entry as immutable
4. Audit trail maintains approval history
5. Matrix assignments ensure proper routing

## Implementation Steps
1. Update database schema for teams and assignments
2. Create manager authentication system
3. Build manager dashboard with team filtering
4. Implement approval workflow with immutability
5. Add company oversight capabilities
6. Create audit trail system
