# Signedwork Platform - Complete Backup

**Backup Created**: $(date)
**Project Version**: Professional Networking Platform with Work Diary Verification
**Last Major Feature**: Secure Work Diary Sharing for Job Applications

## Project Structure

### Core Application
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite (`client/`)
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript (`server/`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Shared**: Common schemas and validation (`shared/`)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Employee Work Diary System** - Professional work tracking with detailed entries
2. **Company Verification Workflow** - Approve/reject work entries with ratings
3. **Immutable Work Records** - Approved entries become tamper-proof
4. **Secure Job Applications** - Only verified work history shared with recruiters
5. **Session-based Authentication** - Employee and company login systems
6. **Admin Panel** - Platform management and user administration
7. **Job Discovery Platform** - AI-powered job search and application system
8. **Email Verification** - OTP-based signup and profile verification
9. **Google OAuth Integration** - Easy employee authentication
10. **Object Storage** - Profile pictures and document attachments

### Recent Security Enhancement
- **Verified-Only Sharing**: Job applications now filter to show only company-approved and immutable work entries
- **UI Security Indicators**: Clear notices showing verification status
- **Backend Filtering**: API endpoints ensure only verified data is shared

### Database Schema
- Users (employees and companies)
- Work entries with approval status
- Company-employee relationships
- Job listings and applications
- Email verification records
- Admin feedback system

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Database configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Frontend build configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### Environment Variables Required
- DATABASE_URL - PostgreSQL connection
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET - OAuth authentication
- SENDGRID_API_KEY - Email services
- OPENAI_API_KEY - AI job recommendations
- SESSION_SECRET - Session security

## Development Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up environment variables
3. Initialize database: `npm run db:push`
4. Start development: `npm run dev`

## Deployment
- Frontend and backend served together on port 5000
- Uses Replit workflows for process management
- PostgreSQL database via Neon serverless
- Object storage for file uploads

## Business Model
- Professional networking platform focused on work verification
- Companies verify employee work entries (immutable once approved)
- Job seekers share only verified work history with recruiters
- Solves authentication problems in recruitment

## Future Roadmap
- **Blockchain Integration**: Custom blockchain for truly immutable work verification
- **Mobile Application**: Native apps for iOS and Android
- **API Marketplace**: Third-party integrations for HR systems
- **International Expansion**: Multi-language and compliance support
