Main Navigation Bar
The main navigation bar at the top gives you access to all the primary functions of your Upwork client account. It's organized into logical sections: Hire talent, Manage work, Reports, and Messages.
1. Hire Talent (Screenshot 1)
This menu is your starting point for finding and hiring professionals.
Feature

How it's linked
Manage jobs and offers
A dashboard to see all your active job postings and the offers you've sent to freelancers.
This is a high-level overview that links directly to Job posts and proposals and Pending offers.
Job posts and proposals
This is where you can view the jobs you've posted and review the proposals submitted by freelancers for each job.
After you Post a job, freelancers submit proposals which appear here. From here, you can review profiles, message candidates, and send offers.
Pending offers
Shows a list of all the job offers you have extended to freelancers that have not yet been accepted or declined.
This is the step after reviewing proposals and deciding to hire someone. If a freelancer accepts, a contract is created under the Manage work tab.
Find freelancers
This is a general category for sourcing talent.
It contains the primary actions for finding people: Post a job and Search for talent.
Post a job
This takes you to the form (partially visible in the background of your screenshots) where you describe your project, budget, and required skills.
This is the most common way to start. Once posted, it appears in Job posts and proposals and freelancers can apply.
Search for talent
Allows you to proactively browse freelancer profiles using filters like skills, location, and job success score, instead of waiting for them to apply.
If you find a freelancer you like, you can invite them to your job or send them a direct offer. This is an alternative to just posting a job and waiting.
Talent you've hired
A list of all freelancers you have previously worked with.
This is useful for quickly re-hiring someone for a new project. It's linked to your past contracts in the Manage work section.
Talent you've saved
A shortlist of freelancers you have bookmarked during your searches but haven't hired yet.
This acts as a "favorites" list, allowing you to easily find promising candidates later when you're ready to Post a job or send an offer.
Bring talent to Upwork (Any Hire)
A feature that allows you to hire and pay a freelancer you already know (found outside of Upwork) through the platform, using Upwork's contract and payment infrastructure.
This is for formalizing work with existing contacts and keeping all your freelance management in one place.
2. Manage Work (Screenshot 2)
Once you've hired a freelancer, this menu is where you manage the entire project lifecycle.
Feature

Active and past work
A comprehensive view of all your ongoing and completed contracts.
This is the main dashboard for managing projects. It links to Your contracts, Timesheets, and Work diaries.
Your contracts
A detailed list of all your contracts, both active and ended.
From here you can view contract terms, message the freelancer, approve milestones (for fixed-price jobs), or end a contract.
Hourly contract activity
A section specifically for monitoring your hourly projects.
This is where you find Timesheets and Work diaries to track the hours your freelancers are logging.
Timesheets
A summary of the hours billed by your freelancers on a weekly basis.
This is directly linked to the freelancer's Work diary. You review the timesheet before payment is processed.
Work diaries
A detailed, visual log of the freelancer's work on an hourly contract. It includes screenshots of their screen taken at intervals and memos about what they were working on.
This provides transparency for hourly work and is the basis for the hours that appear on the Timesheet.
Custom export
Allows you to download your work data for offline analysis or record-keeping.
This pulls data from your contracts and financial history.
3. Reports (Screenshot 3)
This menu provides financial oversight of your spending on the platform.
