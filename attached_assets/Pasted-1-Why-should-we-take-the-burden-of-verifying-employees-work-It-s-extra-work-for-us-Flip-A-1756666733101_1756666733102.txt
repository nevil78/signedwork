1. ❓ “Why should we take the burden of verifying employees’ work? It’s extra work for us.”

✅ Flip Answer:
“Verification isn’t a burden, it’s an investment. Every 5 minutes you spend verifying saves you weeks of bad hiring, months of underperformance, and lakhs of wasted salary. In fact, companies who verify consistently will attract the best talent faster than those who don’t — because talent knows your stamp has value in the market.”

2. ❓ “What if our employees leave after we verify their records? Then we’ve helped them exit.”

✅ Flip Answer:
“Think of it differently — if your best employees stay hidden, they’ll eventually leave anyway because the market doesn’t see their value. By verifying, you actually become known as the company that grows and builds talent — that attracts even stronger candidates. If you don’t verify, you lose twice: first the talent, and then the credibility.”

3. ❓ “Why can’t we build this tool in-house?”

✅ Flip Answer:
“If it’s in-house, it’s biased and no one outside your company will trust it. A third-party record is like a currency — it only works if everyone accepts it. That’s why LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Naukri exist. Our credibility comes from being independent, and that’s something no in-house tool can buy.”

4. ❓ “What if employees don’t want to share their work reports?”

✅ Flip Answer:
“Great — then only the serious, ambitious ones will share. And those are exactly the kind of employees you want in your company. This naturally filters talent for you without extra cost. If someone doesn’t want to build their career record, that’s already a red flag for recruiters.”

5. ❓ “What if this fails to get adoption?”

✅ Flip Answer:
“Every new system — from LinkedIn profiles to performance reviews — was first questioned. But the ones who adopted early reaped the biggest benefits. Imagine if you were one of the first companies to take LinkedIn seriously — today, you’d be the magnet for talent. This is the same chance, right now.”
