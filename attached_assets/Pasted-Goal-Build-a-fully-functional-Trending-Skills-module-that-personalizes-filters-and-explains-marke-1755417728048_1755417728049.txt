Goal:
Build a fully functional Trending Skills module that personalizes, filters, and explains market demand—seamlessly integrated with search, filters, saved searches, and applications. It must be responsive, fast, and synced with recruiter tags.

A. Data & Scoring

Create a normalized skills taxonomy with fields:

id, name, slug, category, aliases[], relatedSkillIds[], isTechnical, createdAt, updatedAt


Store trend metrics (updated daily or on demand):

jobCount7d, jobCount30d, growthPct = ((7d/30d_avg)-1)*100,
clickThruRate, applyRateFromSkill, region (optional)
trendingScore = (0.6*normalize(jobCount7d) + 0.3*normalize(growthPct) + 0.1*normalize(applyRateFromSkill))


Synonym handling: map query chips to canonical skill via aliases[].

B. APIs

GET /skills/trending?limit=20&location=&role=&experience= → list of skills with trendingScore, jobCount7d, growthPct, jobCountTotal.

GET /jobs?skills=react,python&skillsMode=AND|OR&... → filtered jobs.

POST /employees/:id/skills/pin body { skillId } → pin a skill.

POST /employees/:id/skills/hide body { skillId } → hide a skill.

POST /alerts body { name, skills[], skillsMode, otherFilters } → create job alert.

POST /events for analytics: { type, skillId, context }.

C. UI/UX (Desktop & Mobile)

Trending Skills card

Show top N chips (e.g., 6) with badge: ↑ +growthPct% and small jobCount7d.

“See all” opens a modal/list with search + categories.

Personalization badges: Pinned, New for you, From your profile.

Interactions

Click/press a chip → toggles it into the active filter bar as a selected chip.

Multi-select supported; show AND/OR toggle next to the skills chips (default = OR).

Selected chip shows x to remove; removing updates results immediately.

Long-press (mobile) / hover (desktop) → popover with: description, related skills (quick-add), jobCount7d, growthPct, sample titles.

“Pin” icon on chip (persists to user) and “Hide” (removes from your Trending view).

Placement & Responsiveness

Stays beneath hero and above listings.

Mobile: horizontal scrollable chip row; “See all” opens full-screen sheet.

Desktop: chip grid; “See all” opens right-side panel.

Empty/Fallback States

If no local trend, show global trends; if user hid everything, show “Reset hidden skills”.

D. Search/Filter Integration

Selecting Trending Skills composes with existing filters (location, type, salary, etc.).

Results update with debounced fetch (200–300ms).

Show a tiny result count next to the skills area (e.g., “47 matches”).

E. Personalization Logic

Sort order in the card:

Pinned skills,

Skills from user profile/resume,

High trendingScore globally/regionally,

Related to recent views/applies.

Exclude hidden skills. Cold-start uses global top skills.

If a selected skill is not in profile, show subtle “Skill gap?” CTA → “Add to profile” or “See learning resources”.

F. Learning Nudge (Optional but nice)

In popover, show “Improve skill → courses/resources” link when user lacks it.

G. Analytics & Quality

Track events: trending_view, skill_chip_click, skill_added_to_filter, skills_mode_changed, pin_skill, hide_skill, apply_after_skill_filter.

Log A/B key metrics: CTR, downstream apply rate, dwell time, conversions.

H. Performance

Cache GET /skills/trending for 10–30 min; revalidate on tab focus.

Virtualize long lists; lazy-load popover data.

Keep interactions <100ms; API <300ms p95.

I. Accessibility

Keyboard nav for chips (arrow keys, Enter to toggle, Delete to remove).

ARIA labels: “Trending skill React, up 12 percent, 230 jobs this week”.

J. Acceptance Criteria

Clicking one or more Trending Skills immediately filters jobs; AND/OR works.

Counts and growth shown; tooltips/popovers display detail + related skills.

Pins/hidden persist across sessions and reorder the card.

“See all” modal works on desktop & mobile; search inside modal filters skills.

Can Save Alert from current selection; creating alert succeeds.

Analytics events fire for each interaction.

No visual overlap with Apply buttons; layout responsive and touch-friendly.
