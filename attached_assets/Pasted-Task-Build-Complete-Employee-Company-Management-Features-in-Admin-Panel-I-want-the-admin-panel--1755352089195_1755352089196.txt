Task – Build Complete Employee & Company Management Features in Admin Panel

I want the admin panel to have full control and visibility over employees and companies, including employee history and company transitions.

✅ Features Required

1. Employee Records & History

Show a master list of all employees with details (ID, name, email, position, current company, status).

For each employee, maintain a full work history:

Company name

Joining date

Leaving date (if applicable)

Status (Active / Past Company)

Example:

Employee A worked at Company X (01 Jan 2023 – 01 Jun 2023)

Now works at Company Y (01 Jun 2023 – Present, Active)

2. Company Records & Summary

Show total employees per company.

Show list of employees currently working in that company.

Show list of ex-employees (with their joining/leaving dates).

For each company, display:

Company details (CIN, PAN, verified status).

Current employee count.

Employee history (who joined, who left, when).

3. Employee Transfers Between Companies

If an employee leaves company X and joins company Y:

Mark company X status as “Past Company” with leaving date auto-filled.

Mark company Y as “Active Company” with joining date.

Ensure the employee always has exactly one active company at a time.

4. Admin Controls

Admin can view, edit, or update employee-company relationships.

Admin can correct records (e.g., fix wrong joining date).

Admin can add/remove employees from companies if needed.

Admin can generate reports:

Employees per company

Employees with longest tenure

Ex-employees of a company

Employee career history

5. UI/UX Requirements

In the Admin Panel:

Employee Section: Search/filter employees, view full history.

Company Section: Search/filter companies, view active & ex-employees.

Status indicators:

🟢 Active Company

🔴 Past Company (with leaving date)

Use tables with sorting (by join date, company name, etc.).

🎯 Goal

Build a robust admin panel where I can track:

Every employee’s full career history (companies worked in).

Every company’s employee history (active + past).

Auto-updated statuses when employees switch companies.

Reports & summaries that give me full visibility.
