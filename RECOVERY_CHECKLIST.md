#### Step 1: Assess the Damage
- [ ] Can you access the Replit project?
- [ ] Is the code corrupted or just not running?
- [ ] Is the database accessible?
- [ ] Are environment variables intact?

#### Step 2: Quick Fixes (Try First)
- [ ] Restart the workflow: Stop and start "Start application"
- [ ] Check console logs for specific errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables in Replit secrets
- [ ] Run `npm install` to restore dependencies

#### Step 3: Code Recovery (if needed)
- [ ] Download backup: `signedwork-backup-20250823-075939.tar.gz`
- [ ] Extract files: `tar -xzf signedwork-backup-*.tar.gz`
- [ ] Restore dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Check file permissions and structure

#### Step 4: Database Recovery (if needed)
- [ ] Try connecting to existing database
- [ ] Check DATABASE_URL in environment
- [ ] If data lost, restore from SQL backup
- [ ] If no backup, recreate schema: `npm run db:push`

#### Step 5: Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify all required secrets are set:
  - DATABASE_URL
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID 
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
  - SENDGRID_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_KEY

- [ ] Employee login works
- [ ] Company login works  
- [ ] Work diary functionality
- [ ] Job discovery features
- [ ] Admin panel access
